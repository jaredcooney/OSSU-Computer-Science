Most of the assignments in this course involved incrementally refactoring the codebase of a working
Android application in order to implement several design patterns, remove anti-patterns (code smells), and
better adhere to the SOLID principles. For simplicity, I've included only my final version of this
codebase as proof of completion.

The application is called "Sharing App" and is a simple application that allows a lender (the user) to
keep track of their owned items, which each may or may not be lent out to contacts. Items have names, descriptions,
dimensions, an image, and a status (either "available", or "borrowed" by a particular contact), all of which
can be viewed. The user also has a list of contacts, and contacts can be added or deleted. When the user changes
an item's status to "borrowed", they must indicate which of their contacts is borrowing the item.

Note that, due to the nature of the assignment, much of this code was not written by me.
However, the assignment did require developing an understanding of almost all of the provided code.

Also, some of the variable names in this codebase were decided by the course and
don't follow standard Java naming conventions. Generally I only made style changes in
files that I was intended to modify for the assignment.
