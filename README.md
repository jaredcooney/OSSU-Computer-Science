# OSSU-Computer-Science

I'm currently working through Open Source Society University's computer science curriculum.
You can view the curriculum here:

https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#curriculum

OSSU maintains a curated series of online courses that is "designed according to the degree requirements
of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is
assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS."

As I already have a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign, OSSU suits my situation well.

OSSU is nontraditional in that it is not tied to any particular institution, and as such its students do not
receive a degree upon completion of the curriculum. Instead, we maintain a portfolio of completed assignments and
projects. One advantage of this system is that the organization can choose the best available
online course for each topic without being locked in to using other courses offered by the same school.
I also appreciate that I can take extra time to more thoroughly explore topics I find particularly interesting.

I'm uploading most of my projects to this repository as I progress through the courses, both as proof of
completion and as a demonstration of the skills I've learned. Most of the top-level folders represent series
of courses, with subfolders for each of the individual courses in the series. Note that because OSSU's curriculum
is periodically updated as technologies change and new courses are offered, some of the courses listed on
the page linked above will likely differ from the equivalent ones that I have taken.

I've also spent some time studying material outside of the OSSU curriculum, which I haven't included here.
Most notably, I got my CompTIA A+ certification.

Thanks for taking the time to check this out!
