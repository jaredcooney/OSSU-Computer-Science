# OSSU-Computer-Science

I'm currently working through Open Source Society University's computer science curriculum.
You can view the curriculum here:

https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#curriculum

OSSU maintains a curated collection of online courses that is "designed according to the degree requirements
of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is
assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS."

As I already have a bachelor's degree in liberal arts and sciences from the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign, OSSU suits my situation perfectly.

OSSU is nontraditional in that it is not tied to any particular institution, and as such its students do not
receive a degree upon completion of the curriculum. Instead, we have a portfolio of completed assignments and
projects. One advantage of this system is that the curators of the curriculum can choose the best available
online course for each topic without being locked in to using every other course offered by the respective school.

I am uploading my projects to this repository as I progress through the courses, both as proof of
completion and as a demonstration of the skills I've learned. Note that because OSSU's curriculum
is periodically updated as technologies change and new courses are offered, some of the courses listed on
the page linked above will likely differ from the ones that I have taken by the time I finish the program.

As a final note, I may also upload some projects from relevant
courses that I've taken outside of the OSSU curriculum.
